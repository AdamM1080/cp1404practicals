# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

In response to both time and duration, the honest answer is sporadically... As for location, my house.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have noticed a considerable increase in my ability to recognise different patterns since first trimester.
Whether I get them 100% correct is another question.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to dedicate more time to it. I have withdrawn from a troublesome elective though which will greatly benefit this.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I can already see myself creating extra hurdles through lack of experience with the mechanics of version control.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Enjoying them.
