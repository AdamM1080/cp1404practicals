# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Honestly, not much. The list of processes I need to change in life in general is lengthy, at best.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Immediately, time on task... Just more of that. My attitude is well in need of straightening out as well. 

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Showing up. Got to be in it to win it.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop sacrificing proper naming conventions in an effort of simply submitting a working program.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I generally avoid reflecting on my life in all it's mediums. Also make an "Introduction to synthesisers course". Yesterday.
